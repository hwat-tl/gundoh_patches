# Musashi Gundoh Patches

hwat's releases for Musashi Gundoh use untouched raws from #168417, entirely softsubbed. On the off chance someone already has these and wants to save bandwidth, I've made xdelta patches based on those files. Any v2s and such will go here as well.

## How to use

  1. You will need xdelta3 in the same directory as the original file - I've included a .exe for Windows here; otherwise download from someone you trust
  2. Download the relevant .xdelta files and put them in the same directory as the original file
  3. Do this for the episodes you want to patch: ``xdelta3 -d gundoh[##].xdelta``
  
I'm going to assume that if you want to go to all this trouble in the first place, you should know how to run things from command line.
